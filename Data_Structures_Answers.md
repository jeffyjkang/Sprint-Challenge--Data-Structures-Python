Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) each node is visited and a value provided

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
   O(n) each node value is stored

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) each node is visited and a value provided

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) each node value is stored

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n^2) nested for loop, compares each iteration with a second iteration

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n) compared values with same name are returned and stored

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n) set intersections, will run and compare the two set intersections for
   each value in both sets

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n) compared values with same name are returned and stored
