Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) each node is visited and a value provided

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
   O(n) worst case

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) each node is visited and a value provided

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) each node value is stored
   O(2^log n) for balanced tree

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n\*m) n for names in name_1 , m for names in name_2

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n \* m) total number of elements
   O(min(n,m))

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n) set intersections, will run and compare the two set intersections for
   each value in both sets

   binary search or binary search tree : O (n log n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   n would be len of names_1
   m would be len of names_2
   O(m + n)
   O(n) worst case when all names are duplicates

   binary search tree: O (m + n)
   binary search: O(n)
